# VuDesigner
An experimental project by Maurice FreuwÃ¶rt  
Started: **15. January 2020**  

## What's this software supposed to solve?
TL;DR a software for efficient web based UI creation.  

VuDesigner is a software development tool written in Node.js (Electron.js) specifically designed for efficient web based UI creation through autocompletion and prefabricated assets. Much like other tools such as Emmet it strives to make the programming part of the design-development workflow the minimal concern. This will be achieved and accompanied by a full keyboard-shortcut control over the most important parts of the software and a range of quality-of-life features listed below:
* Autocompletion including favorised assets
* An asset marketplace for intricate user generated assets
* âœ” Live preview with custom viewport size support
* Quick project launch - meaning one-click setup for custom folder structures + git initialization
* On-the-fly sass and scss compilation with sophisticated output options
* Cloud saving assets, files and settings
* Export options:
    * File export ( .html, .css, .sass )
    * Text export ( copy-paste the parts you need )
* Embedded colorpicker with swatches
* Embedded icon picker
* ... and more

This collection of ideas also states the roadmap or rather the upcoming updates for this project (although the list is not set in stone and new ideas for additions are very much appreciated).

## Disclaimer
This idea came from my desire for a tool like this. I'm not working fulltime on Vudesigner nor am I capible of financially supporting it more than I do now. I simply cannot guarantee for a set list of features before I haven't decide on making Vudesigner into a commercial product. I will however do my absolute best to keep the promises listed above. And just to mention it: although this project may be openly available I do not support the altering or republishing of it. After all this is my 'brain child'. ðŸ˜…
