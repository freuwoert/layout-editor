# Layout Editor (WIP)
An experimental project by Maurice Freuwört  
Started on: 15.01.2020

## What's this software supposed to solve?
TL;DR Software for efficient web based UI creation.  

Layout Editor is a software development tool written in Node.js (Electron.js) specifically designed for efficient web based UI creation through autocompletion and prefabricated assets. Much like other tools such as Emmet it strives to make the programming part of the design-development workflow the minimal concern. This will be achieved and accompanied by a full keyboard-shortcut control over the most important parts of the software and a range of quality-of-life features listed below:
* Autocompletion including favorised assets
* A sophisticated marketplace for intricate user generated assets
* Live preview with custom viewport size support
* Quick project launch - meaning one-click setusp for custom folder structures + git initialisation
* Cloud saving assets, files and settings
* Export options:
    * File export ( .html, .css, .sass )
    * Text export ( copy-paste the parts you need )
* Embedded colorpicker with swatches
* Embedded icon picker
* ... and more

This collection of ideas also states the roadmap or rather the upcoming updates for this project (although the list is not set in stone and new ideas for additions are very much appreciated).

### Disclaimer
This idea came from my desire for this tool. I'm not working fulltime on nor am I capible of financially supporting this project more than I do now. I simply cannot guarantee for a set list of features before I decide to make this into a commercial product. I will however do my absolute best to keep the promises listed above.
