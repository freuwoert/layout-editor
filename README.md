# VuDesigner
A passion project by Maurice FreuwÃ¶rt  
Started: **15. January 2020**   

## What problem does this software solve?
TL;DR VuDesigner is a software for efficient UI creation and code generation.  

VuDesigner is a software development tool written in electron.js designed for efficient UI creation. I often times describe it as a combination of Adobe XD and Webflow. Much like other tools such as Emmet it strives to make the programming part of the design-development workflow the minimal concern by generating usable, ready-to-copy code.
Listed below are some of the upcomming and planned features:
* An asset marketplace for intricate user generated assets
* Live preview - that is basically a requirement in 2020
* Quick project initiation - meaning one-click setup for custom folder structures + git initialization and so on
* Cloud saving assets, files and settings
* Export options:
    * File export ( .html, .css, .sass )
    * Text export ( copy-paste the parts you need )
* âœ… Embedded colorpicker
* âœ… Embedded icon picker
* CMS functionalities

This collection of ideas also states the roadmap or rather the upcoming updates for this project (although the list is not set in stone and new ideas for additions are very much appreciated).

## See it in action - kinda
Lately I've been streaming a lot of the progress I'm making with this project.  
Tune in to my Twitch at [twitch.com/morriis_](https://www.twitch.tv/morriis_)  
It's mostly german though.  

## Supporting this project
You can now support this project and even get beta access (once it gets there) through my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/freuwoert).  

## Disclaimer
This idea came from my desire for a tool like this. I'm not working fulltime on VuDesigner nor am I capible of financially supporting it more than I do now. I simply cannot guarantee for a set list of features before I haven't decide on making Vudesigner into a commercial product. I will however do my absolute best to keep the promises listed above. And just to mention it: although this project may be openly available I do not support the altering or republishing of it. After all this is my 'brain child'. ðŸ˜…
