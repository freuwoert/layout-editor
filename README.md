## About this software?
TL;DR  
VuDesigner is a software for efficient UI creation and code generation.  

VuDesigner is a software development tool written in electron.js designed for efficient UI creation. I often times describe it as a combination of Adobe XD and Webflow. Much like other tools such as Emmet it strives to make the programming part of the design-development workflow the minimal concern by generating usable, ready-to-copy code.
Listed below are some of the upcomming and planned features:
* [ ] An asset marketplace for intricate user generated assets
* [ ] Live preview - that is basically a requirement in 2020
* [ ] Quick project initiation - meaning one-click setup for custom folder structures + git initialization and so on
* [ ] Cloud saving assets, files and settings
* [ ] Export as file or copy to clipboard
* [x] Embedded colorpicker
* [x] Embedded icon picker
* [ ] CMS functionalities

(Ideas for additions are very much appreciated)

## See it in action - kinda
Lately I've been streaming a lot of the progress I'm making with this project.  
Tune in to my Twitch at [twitch.com/morriis_](https://www.twitch.tv/morriis_)  
It's mostly german though.    

## Disclaimer
This idea stamps from my desire for a tool like this. I'm not working fulltime on VuDesigner nor am I capable of financially supporting it more than I do now. I simply cannot guarantee a set list of features before I haven't decided on making Vudesigner into a commercial product.  
EDIT: I will not, do whatever you want with it.
